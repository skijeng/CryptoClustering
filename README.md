# CryptoClustering

For this project, I used the in class challeges as reference to each step. The only issue I encountered: I could not get the hvplot to display an output. For the first elbow curve, you'll see there's no output. Do to this issue, I used pyplot for the remainder of the project. I found as well, using four clusters from the beginning made the most sense, as that is where both elbows appeared.
